the example above, the HTML creates a web page with five distinct parts.

The grid-template-areas declaration in the .container rule set creates a 2-column, 4-row layout.

The grid-template-rows declaration specifies the height of each of the four rows from top to bottom: 
300 pixels, 120 pixels, 800 pixels, and 120 pixels.

The grid-template-columns declaration uses the fr value to cause the left column to use one fourth of 
the available space on the page and the right column to use three-fourths of the available space on the 
page.

In each rule set below .container, we use the grid-area property to tell that section to cover the 
portion of the page specified. The header element spans the first row and both columns. The nav element 
spans the second row and both columns. The element with class .info spans the third row and left column. 
The element with class .services spans the third row and right column. The footer element spans the 
bottom row and both columns.

Thatâ€™s it! An entire page laid out in 40 lines of code.
