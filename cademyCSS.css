Hexadecimal or hex colors

Hexadecimal is a number system with has sixteen digits, 0 to 9 followed by “A” to “F”.

Hex values always begin with # and specify values of red, blue and green using hexademical numbers 
such as #23F41A.

RGB colors use the rgb() syntax with one value for red, one value for blue and one value for green.

RGB values range from 0 to 255 and look like this: rgb(7, 210, 50).

HSL stands for hue (the color itself), saturation (the intensity of the color), and lightness 
(how light or dark a color is).

Hue ranges from 0 to 360 and saturation and lightness are both represented as percentages like this: 
hsl(200, 20%, 50%).

You can add opacity to color in RGB and HSL by adding a fourth value, a, which is represented as a 
percentage.
